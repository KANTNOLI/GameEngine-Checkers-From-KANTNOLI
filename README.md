Installation (**1.0 release**) -> 
- unpack to a convenient location      - (**require**)
- (terminal) cd client                 - (optional)
- (terminal) npm i                     - (optional)
- (terminal) cd ../server <- OR -> cd server - (**require**)
- (terminal) npm i                     - (optional)
- (terminal) node .\app.js             - (**require**)
- (terminal output) **http://localhost:1000**
- CTRL + LCLICK to open 

Engine (**0.7.4**) -> 
- **Cameras** - Camera settings. There are many camera setup options, including conditional snippets. (**2**)
- **Lighting** - Scene light settings. Snippets designed to create light quickly. (**6**)
- **Objects** - These are objects, or object settings for quick rendering of the scene. For example, checkers for the game. (**1**) 
- **PlayerActions** - One of the cool themes! Character management files are stored here. At the moment there is 1 control file relative to the orbit of something. (**3**)
- **VisualEngineConfigs** - Visual engine settings, in fact, settings of the same engine, although in the future there is an option to conveniently replace and add another, but at the moment, it makes no sense. (**1**)
- **OtherScripts** - A module designed for separate scripts, so as not to create hundreds of modules. Renderings of elements can be stored there, for example, initial placement or conditionally mouse tracking. In short, everything that does not fit other modules goes there, if this function is not more important than, for example, light. (**2**)

P.S. **Before the release of 1.0 or 2.0**, depending on the circumstances, most of the functions will be aimed specifically at my task. After that, the engine will be upgraded to the ability to create different other simple ones

**Actual release**
