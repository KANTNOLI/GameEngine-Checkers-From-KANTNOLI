Installation (Actual 0.6.3 && less) ->

Engine (Actual 0.6.3 && less) -> 
- **Cameras** - Camera settings. There are many camera setup options, including conditional snippets. (1)
- **Lighting** - Scene light settings. Snippets designed to create light quickly. (1)
- **Objects** - These are objects, or object settings for quick rendering of the scene. For example, checkers for the game. (1) 
- **PlayerActions** - One of the cool themes! Character management files are stored here. At the moment there is 1 control file relative to the orbit of something. (1)
- **VisualEngineConfigs** - Visual engine settings, in fact, settings of the same engine, although in the future there is an option to conveniently replace and add another, but at the moment, it makes no sense. (1)

P.S. Before the release of 1.0 or 2.0, depending on the circumstances, most of the functions will be aimed specifically at my task. After that, the engine will be upgraded to the ability to create different other simple ones
